\section*{Abstract}
To achieve adequate quality acoustics in audio studios, it is often resorted to the use of acoustic panels, which modify the sound waves of a room that was not initially designed for the purpose of recording audio, or any other function where sound quality is important. However, even though the field of acoustics is deeply studied, the installation of acoustic panels is still a largely empirical and limited process, because different instruments require different acoustics, and the approach of the panels is to seek ``acceptable'' acoustics for a wide range of instruments. This project aims to design and implement a system that automates the acoustic conditioning in enclosures through the movement of sound modification panels. For this purpose, our proposal consists of a system of moving acoustic panels, which change the surface that is in direct contact with the waves generated in the audio studio and change the response of the enclosure. The system will be intelligent, as it will adjust the acoustics of the room depending on the instrument to be played in it. The system will allow, in addition to having a suitable acoustic for each instrument, to be able to perform acoustic conditioning automatically.
